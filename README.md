# Overview

In this repository, I have written a pong game using Python programming language. The game is built using turtle and winsound/pygame libraries. The game can be played by two players, and the objective of the game is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle to score points.

# Game Description

To play the game, use the up and down arrow keys for player one and the W and S keys for player two to move the paddles. The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddles, and the player who misses the ball will lose a point.

# Purpose

The main purpose of writing this software is to improve my skills as a software engineer, particularly in game development using Python. Through this project, I practiced using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and learned how to use Python libraries like turtle and pygame.

# Software Demo

Check out the following link for a 5-minute demo of the game and a walkthrough of the code:

# Development Environment

I used Python version 3.11.5 for this project, with the following libraries:
- turtle (for drawing and animation)
- winsound/pygame (for sound effects)

# Useful Websites

These websites were helpful in completing this project:
- [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [W3Schools Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Pygame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

# Future Work

Here are some improvements that can be made in the future:
- Add a menu and settings screen for the game
- Add power-ups and special features to the game
- Fix the background music so it will play until the song is over
